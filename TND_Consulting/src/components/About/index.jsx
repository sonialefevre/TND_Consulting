                I love to improve and challenge what is in place, I will never let a place without adding my enhancement touch.
                </p>
                <p>
                I am passionate about my work and especially my functional areas (Absence & Time tracking), I keep myself informed and trained and learn every day something new (even after 4 years full time on it)
                </p>
                <p>
                I have a "talent" for finding workarounds, sometimes Workday can be limited and not fit the client requirements, I always try to find at least a middle ground by reaching the system limits    
                </p>
                <p>
                I have a financial background and programming interests, I am crazy about Excel and love data transformation, data loading and making analysis, which is generally uncommon for Workday consultants
