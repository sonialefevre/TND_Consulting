            I love to improve and challenge what is in place, I will never let a
            place without adding my enhancement touch.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am passionate about my work and especially my functional areas
            (Absence & Time tracking), I keep myself informed and trained and
            learn every day something new (even after 4 years full time on it).
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a "talent" for finding workarounds, sometimes Workday can be
            limited and not fit the client requirements, I always try to find at
            least a middle ground by reaching the system limits.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a financial background and programming interests, I am crazy
            about Excel and love data transformation, data loading and making
            analysis, which is generally uncommon for Workday consultants.
